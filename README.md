✅ **Python** – for test scripting

 #     My Assumptions                                      
1. The assignment task is relevant and highly engaging.     
2. Test scenarios are designed to uncover hidden failures, which is hidden from standard_user account. Automation detects this issues which is very important, ****not just**** create a blank framework which starts browsers sessions, clicks something and thats it. 
3. I have used openAI's chatgpt for consulting on errors I'm facing and to create this nice and informative Readme file
4. While doing this test assigment I was dreaming to join the company
5. French buldog with ball found as well as price changes, UI glitches in visual_user, missing fields on checkout and cart icon on wrong place.
